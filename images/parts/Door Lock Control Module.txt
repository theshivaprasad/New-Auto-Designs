INFO - Door Control Unit (DCU) is a generic term for an embedded system that controls a number of electrical systems associated with an advanced motor vehicle.

The Door Control Unit is responsible for controlling and monitoring various electronic accessories in a vehicle's door. Since most of the vehicles have more than one door, generally DCUs are present in each door separately.
