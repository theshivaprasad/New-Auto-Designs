INFO - Door Control Unit (DCU) is a generic term for an embedded system that controls a number of electrical systems associated with an advanced motor vehicle. An advanced motor vehicle consists of a number of ECUs (Electrical Control Units), and the Door Control Unit (DCU) is an important one among them.
The Door Control Unit is responsible for controlling and monitoring various electronic accessories in a vehicle's door. Since most of the vehicles have more than one door, generally DCUs are present in each door separately.
Modules will need to have an exact part match, please provide your exact part number and Modules must be reset by a dealer before installing.
